# Welcome to our vocabulary review tool!

This tool is designed to help you review the vocabulary words you encounter in your listening exercises, readings, and other English language materials.

The tool is built using a combination of Notion for the database, the Notion API to consume the vocabulary words, Express to create a REST API and provide endpoints for accessing the words, and a small frontend to allow you to review and test yourself on the meanings of the words.

To launch the application, run the command npm run start. To run it in debug mode, use npm run debug.

We hope you find this tool helpful in your language learning journey!
